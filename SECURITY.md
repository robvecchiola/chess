# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project does not maintain multiple supported release lines. Security fixes are applied to the `main` branch only. Keep your deployment updated.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| main | yes |
| older tags/commits | no |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues via GitHub Security Advisories. If that is not available, open a private issue or contact the maintainer directly.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days and provide a remediation plan if the issue is confirmed.
